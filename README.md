# icebreaker

This is the first ever tool for editing cutscenes in NFS Most Wanted and limited viewing of them in some other NFS games. It targets EAGLAnim chunks in NIS bundles and CameraTrack chunks in InGameB bundle.

The code is horrendous and no good and very ugly. It came to be through rapid prototyping and black-box testing and then was never refactored. Still I believe that it being open source could be of some benefit to the community, since I don't plan to support it anymore.

You will need Unity 2021.1.24f1 to open this project. You can try other versions but it might break.
